    <h3>I am a computer science 3rd year Ph.D. student at SMU SCIS supervised by Prof. Zhu Feida. 
        My research focus is on Illicit Address Detection on Crypto Transaction Networks. 
        I utilize Graph Theory, Machine Learning, Graph Neural Network, and Survival Analysis to develop Deep-Learning models for malice detection. 
        While my research interests primarily lie in the crypto malice detection field, 
        I am eager to expand my knowledge and experience in the web 3.0 industry and apply AI techniques to related fields.</h3>

      <h3>Evolve Path Tracer: Early Detection of Malicious Addresses in Cryptocurrency</h3>
      <p> With the boom of cryptocurrency and its concomitant financial risk concerns, detecting fraudulent behaviors and associated malicious addresses has been drawing significant research effort. 
   Most existing studies, however, rely on the full history features or full-fledged address transaction networks, both of which are unavailable in the problem of early malicious address detection and therefore failing them for the task.
   To detect fraudulent behaviors of malicious addresses in the early stage, we present Evolve Path Tracer
   which consists of Evolve Path Encoder LSTM, Evolve Path Graph GCN, and Hierarchical Survival Predictor.
   Specifically, in addition to the general address features, we propose Asset Transfer Paths and corresponding path graphs to characterize early transaction patterns. 
   Furthermore, since transaction patterns change rapidly in the early stage, 
   we propose Evolve Path Encoder LSTM and Evolve Path Graph GCN to encode asset transfer path and path graph under an evolving structure setting.
   Hierarchical Survival Predictor then predicts addresses' labels with high scalability and efficiency. 
   We investigate the effectiveness and generalizability of Evolve Path Tracer on three real-world malicious address datasets. 
   Our experimental results demonstrate that Evolve Path Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 
   Extensive scalability experiments demonstrate the model's adaptivity under a dynamic prediction setting.</p>

      <h3>From Asset Flow to Status, Action and Intention Discovery: Early Malice Detection in Cryptocurrency</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrency has been subject to illicit activities probably more often than traditional financial asset due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of its transacting entities. 
        An ideal detection model is expected to achieve all three critical properties of (I) early detection, (II) good interpretability, and (III) versatility for various illicit activities. 
        However, existing solutions cannot meet all these requirements, as most of them heavily rely on deep learning without interpretability and are only available for retrospective analysis of a specific illicit type.
        To tackle all these challenges, we propose Intention-Monitor for early malice detection in bitcoin (BTC), where the on-chain record data for a certain address are much scarcer than other cryptocurrency platforms.
        We first define asset transfer paths with the Decision-Tree based feature Selection and Complement (DT-SC) to build different feature sets for different malice types. 
        Then, the Status/Action Proposal Module (S/A-PM) and the intention-VAE module generate the status, action, and hidden intention units. With all these modules, our model is highly interpretable and can detect various illegal activities. 
        Moreover, well-designed loss functions further enhance the prediction speed and model's interpretability.
        Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
        Furthermore, additional case studies justify our model can not only explain existing illicit patterns but can also find new suspicious characters.
